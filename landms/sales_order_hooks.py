"""Sales Order lifecycle hooks for LandMS plot sales.

The Sales Order is the commercial anchor for the plot sale:

  Plot Application (application fee paid)
    -> Sales Order (submitted, gets TCB control number)
    -> Draft Plot Contract (created immediately from SO)
    -> First advance payment
    -> Single Plot Sales Invoice (created on first advance only)
    -> Plot Contract auto-submits and mirrors SI / PE state

Important business rules from the user / legacy LMS:
  - The application fee is separate; it never becomes part of the plot SI.
  - The plot SI is created only after the first advance is received.
  - All later installments continue against that same single SI.
  - If the first advance is never received before the application validity
    window expires, the application and its Sales Order are auto-cancelled.
