"""One settings record per project (LA-7): what LandMS Settings holds, per project.

Left out, staying in LandMS Settings: the receipt verification address (one for the whole
system) and the TCB log naming series (it belongs to the channel).

Named after its project, so there is exactly one per project. A new project gets its record
empty and Finance fills it; the project cannot be approved while a field marked * is empty.
The government fees are informational (shown on plot documents, never posted). Projects that
existed before LA-7 get an exact copy of LandMS Settings (patch create_project_settings).
Not searchable and in no workspace: opened from the project's Connections. Code reads it only
through accounts_for(project).

LandMS Settings stays as it is: later cards move each reader to accounts_for, one place at a
time; card X-7 keeps the list of every place.
