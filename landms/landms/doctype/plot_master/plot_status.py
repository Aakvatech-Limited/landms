"""The one place that changes a plot's status (PM-1).

Before PM-1, fourteen places in four files wrote Plot Master.status straight into the
database: nothing recorded who changed it or why, and the rules lived in each caller.
Now every change goes through set_plot_status(), which

  * checks the move against ALLOWED_INTO (the moves the app made before PM-1 — not one
    move that worked then is refused now; the four unchecked ones are marked and wait
    for an operator decision), and
  * leaves a plain-words note on the plot's timeline: from, to, who, why, and the
    document behind it.

Callers keep their own "only when the plot is X" checks through `only_from`.
